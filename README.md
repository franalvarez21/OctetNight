You can:
- Plant seeds
- Harvest crops
- Gather items from the nearby ruins
- Sell items and buy seeds packs from the local store
- Sheep!

Due to memory space, a lot of the game mechanics are simplified.. extremely simplified.

## Emulation notes

There is an emulator named 'ProjectABE' that can be used. Feel free to check it out!

## Sound

There is no sound in this game due to the memory available, after optimizations are done it can be added in.

## Details

Nice to have (under consideration):
- Sound.
- Code space optimizations.
